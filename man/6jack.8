.SH "NAME"
\fB6jack\fR \- A framework for analyzing/testing/fuzzing network applications
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fB6jack\fR \fIfilter\fR \fIcommand\fR [\fIargs\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fB6jack\fR runs a command, intercepts calls to common network\-related functions and passes them through a filter as \fBMessagePack\fR serialized objects\.
.
.P
\fB6jack\fR works at application level\. It\'s a simple library that gets preloaded before the actual application\.
.
.P
\fBPre\-filters\fR can inspect and alter the content prior to calling the actual function\. A \fBpre\-filter\fR can also totally bypass the actual call, in order to simulate a call without actually hitting the network\.
.
.P
\fBPost\-filters\fR can inspect and alter the content after the actual call\. In particular, \fBpost\-filters\fR can change return codes and the \fBerrno\fR value in order to simulate failures\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fIcommand\fR is the name of the command to run\.
.
.P
\fIfilter\fR is the absolute path to an application that receives a stream of \fBMessagePack\fR serialized objects on \fBstdin\fR and for every object, should push a serialized reply to \fBstdout\fR\.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
When a \fBSIXJACK_BYPASS\fR environment variable is defined, calls are not diverted to the filter any more\.
.
.P
An application is free to set and unset \fBSIXJACK_BYPASS\fR, in order to explicitly disable \fB6jack\fR in some sections\.
.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
\fB6jack\fR returns the exit value of \fIcommand\fR after completion\.
.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
\fB6jack\fR has been designed as a tool for testing applications\.
.
.P
It is not suitable for running in a production environment or with untrusted data / filters\.
.
.SH "WWW"
